# draw-advanced — ArcGIS Experience Builder Widget

A feature-rich drawing widget for [ArcGIS Experience Builder](https://developers.arcgis.com/experience-builder/) that extends native drawing capabilities with advanced geometry tools, live measurements, coordinate display, and data management.

> [!NOTE]
> This repository is a personal project used to explore GitHub workflows and Claude Code capabilities. It is based on an open-source widget originally developed by the community.

## Features

### Drawing tools

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| Point | Single marker |
| Polyline | Multi-segment line with optional arrowheads |
| Freehand polyline | Smooth hand-drawn line |
| Rectangle | Axis-aligned bounding rectangle |
| Polygon | Multi-sided polygon |
| Freehand polygon | Smooth hand-drawn polygon |
| Circle | Radius-based circle |
| Text | Annotation with full font control |

### Live drawing tooltip

A real-time overlay near the cursor appears while drawing and disappears automatically when the shape is completed:

| Tool | Tooltip content |
|---|---|
| Circle | Radius in nautical miles (NM), or metres for very small radii |
| Rectangle | Width and height in metres / km |
| Polygon | Current segment length in metres / km |
| Polyline | Current segment length in metres / km |

### Shape info popup

Click any drawn shape after completion to open an information panel:

- **Circle, Rectangle, Point** — center coordinates in four formats: Decimal Degrees (DD), Degrees Minutes Seconds (DMS), Degrees Decimal Minutes (DDM), and MGRS
- **Polygon / Freehand Polygon** — area (auto-scaled to m², ha, or km²) and perimeter
- **Circle** — radius in nautical miles
- **Rectangle** — area and perimeter
- **Polyline / Freehand Polyline** — total length (auto-scaled to m / km)

Closes on outside click, `Escape`, or when a new drawing tool is activated.

### Coordinate display

Center coordinates (WGS84 Lon/Lat) shown on measurement labels for circles and rectangles, with native-CRS fallback.

### Symbology

- Point: simple marker and picture marker symbols
- Line: stroke color, width, style, and optional arrowheads (start/end/both)
- Polygon: fill color and stroke
- Text: font family, size, weight, style, color, halo, opacity, alignment, rotation

### Data management

- **My Drawings panel** — list, rename, reorder, and edit symbology for all drawn graphics
- **Export** — Shapefile (`.zip`) or GeoJSON
- **Import** — from any feature layer, graphics layer, GeoJSON layer, or CSV layer in the map
- **Copy/Paste** — copy features from any visible map layer into the drawing layer
- **Undo/Redo** — full history stack

### Other

- **Buffer zones** — configurable distance and unit around any geometry
- **Storage scope** — persist drawings per-app or globally across all apps (configurable in ExB settings)

## Requirements

- ArcGIS Experience Builder **1.17+**
- An ArcGIS Online or ArcGIS Enterprise account to run Experience Builder

---

## Installation

1. Copy (or symlink) the `draw-advanced` folder into your Experience Builder extensions directory:

   ```
   <ExB root>/client/your-extensions/widgets/draw-advanced
   ```

2. Start the ExB dev server from the ExB root:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

3. Open the Experience Builder app in your browser, add the **draw-advanced** widget to your experience, and configure the target map widget in the settings panel.

> [!NOTE]
> The widget has no standalone build step — it compiles as part of ExB's webpack pipeline.

## Branch overview

| Branch | Description |
|---|---|
| `main` | Baseline widget with all core drawing features |
| `add_polygons_coordinates` | Adds center coordinates display (WGS84 Lon/Lat) on measurement labels |
| `feature/live-drawing-tooltip` | Adds real-time cursor tooltip (radius, segment length) during drawing |
| `feature/shape-info-popup` | Adds click popup with DD/DMS/DDM/MGRS coordinates and measurements |

## Development notes

- No unit tests — manual testing via the ExB dev server.
- ESRI imports: both `esri/…` (AMD) and `@arcgis/core/…` (ESM) styles are valid; prefer `@arcgis/core/` for new code.
- `IMConfig` is a `seamless-immutable` object — use `.set(key, value)` to update it; never mutate directly.
- `widget.tsx` uses `/** @jsx jsx */` + `jsx` from `jimu-core` for ExB theming.
- User-facing strings live in `src/runtime/translations/default.ts`; reference them via `this.nls('key')`.
- The `cursor-update` event on `SketchViewModel` exposes `evt.graphics[]` (array), unlike `create` which exposes `evt.graphic` (singular).
